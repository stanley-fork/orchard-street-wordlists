# FAQ 

## Can I have my password manager use a Orchard Street Wordlist?

Some password managers allow users to use any given wordlist file to generate passphrases. [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org) is one such password manager.

To have KeePassXC use one of these wordlists, click on KeePassXC's dice icon to open the password generator, then click over to the "Passphrase" tab, then click to + button to choose a word list file.

## How can I use dice to create a passphrase?

I'd point you to [the EFF's guide on how to do this](https://www.eff.org/dice). Note that you will have to use either the Orchard Street Medium List or one of the Short Lists.

## Do you recommend a CLI tool for generating passphrases?

You could probably do worse than [Micah Lee's passphraseme tool](https://github.com/micahflee/passphraseme). Use the `-d` / `--dictionary` option to use an Orchard Street Wordlist file.

## How _many_ words should I use in a passphrase?

That depends on your threat model, so I can't give a general answer. But if I were forced to give a general rule of thumb, I'd say using 6 words from the long or medium lists (e.g. "fig phases telephone cowboys warning lit") and 7 words from a short list (e.g. "robe towed wooded cue hasty cups 
each") is a safe bet.

## I'm creating a passphrase I know I'll frequently be entering into a smart TV or video game console. Which list should I use?

Entering passwords on a smart TV remote or video game controller is a pain. To make this easier, the Orchard Street Short Lists are optimized to minimize the number of "clicks" you must execute to enter a passphrase. 

This number of clicks depends on the keyboard layout. If the service's password keyboard looks like a traditional QWERTY layout:

```txt
qwertyuiop
asdfghjkl
zxcvbnm
```

use the [Orchard Street Qwerty list](lists/orchard-street-qwerty.txt). 

If it's in alphabetical order:

```txt
abcdef
ghijkl
mnopqr
stuvwx
yz
```

use [Orchard Street Alpha](lists/orchard-street-alpha.txt).

## I'm creating passphrase-generation software. Can I use one or more of the Orchard Street Wordlists in my code?

Sure! Just be sure to follow the licensing (see Readme).

## How were the Orchard Street Wordlists created?

The words that make up these word lists are taken from two sources: [Google Books Ngram data](https://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv3.html) and [a Wikipedia word frequency project](https://github.com/IlyaSemenov/wikipedia-word-frequency/).

The lists were made uniquely decodable using a process based on [the Sardinasâ€“Patterson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinas%E2%80%93Patterson_algorithm) that I call [Schlinkert pruning](https://sts10.github.io/2022/08/12/efficiently-pruning-until-uniquely-decodable.html). 

### What tools were used to create the Orchard Street Wordlists?

- [Tidy](https://github.com/sts10/tidy): A command-line utility for editing word lists. 
- [Common Word List Maker](https://github.com/sts10/common_word_list_maker): Scrapes Google Books Ngram data to create a long word list of commonly used words
